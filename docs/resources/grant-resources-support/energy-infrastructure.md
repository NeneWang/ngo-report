# ENERGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE

#### Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme

##### (ESMAP)

**What activities does the program fund?** ESMAP is a global
technical assistance program that promotes the role of energy in
poverty reduction and economic growth in an environmentally
responsible manner. Its work applies to low-income, emerging, and
transition economies and contributes to the achievement of
internationally agreed development goals.
Through studies, pilot projects and training, ESMAP strives to
expand the global knowledge base about its priority areas: market-
oriented sector reform and restructuring, energy access to the un- or
under-served especially in rural areas, and environmentally
sustainable energy practices. Activities should also contribute to the
institutional and human capacity in the recipient country; address
poverty, social and gender issues; and be innovative in developing,
testing, and mainstreaming ideas and approaches.

**Who is eligible?** All stakeholders in the energy sector:
governments, private sector, research institutions and NGOs.

**How to apply?** ESMAP activities are managed by World Bank
energy specialists. Proposals for activities are submitted to the
Manager of ESMAP and reviewed by independent experts. Non-
World Bank Group proponents need to secure the commitment of a
World Bank energy specialist before their proposals can be
considered by ESMAP. ESMAP staff are available to put proponents
in touch with World Bank energy staff and can be contacted at
address below. Further information is available on its website.
