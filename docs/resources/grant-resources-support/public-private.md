# Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility

##### (PPIAF)

**What activities does the Program fund?** PPIAF is a multi-
donor technical assistance facility aimed at helping developing
country governments improve the quality of their infrastructure
through private sector involvement. PPIAF pursues its objectives
through (i) channeling technical assistance to governments in
developing countries on strategies and measures to tap the full
potential of private sector involvement in infrastructure, and (ii)
identifying, disseminating and promoting emerging best practices
on matters related to private sector involvement in infrastructure in
developing countries.

PPIAF funds country specific or multi-country advisory and related
activities in the following areas: infrastructure development
strategies, capacity and consensus building, policy, regulatory, and
institutional reforms, and pioneering transactions. Eligible
infrastructure services include water and sewerage, solid waste,
electricity generation, transmission and distribution, natural gas
transmission and distribution, telecommunications, airports, ports,
railways, and roads.

**Who is eligible?** PPIAF can support activities intended to benefit
any developing and transition country included in the following
categories of the OECD Development Assistance Committeeâ€™s List of
Aid Recipients: Developing Countries and Territories (all five
columns of the Part I table); and Countries and Territories in
Transition (column one of the Part II table). Proposals for PPIAF
support can originate from any source. Note, however, that since
PPIAF donors have agreed to utilize World Bank procurement
guidelines to implement PPIAF activities, the World Bank through
its designated task managers execute activities on behalf of PPIAF.
Proposals for country-specific activities require approval in writing
from the relevant government.
**How to apply?** Guidelines and information are available on the
PPIAF website or from PPIAF Program Management.
