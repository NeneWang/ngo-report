Koonin[ wrote in The Wall Street Journal in 2014](https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-science-is-not-settled-1411143565). \u201cBut as far as the computer models go, there isn\'t a useful consensus at the level of detail relevant to assessing human influences.\u201d The idea was that the world needed more data before it could respond to the threat posed by global warming\u2014assuming such research indicated a response was even necessary.\\n\\nToday, outright denialism is dormant, but delay tactics have never been more in vogue. Many of them fall under the banner of what I\u2019d call thinkwashing, a combination of willful ignorance of existing knowledge, policy perfectionism, and an all-or-nothing position on the role of technology in society. It\u2019s not limited to climate change, either. People thinkwash whenever they magnify the complexity of the problem and undermine real possibilities. Whatever the issue, entrenched interests have perfected their response: It\u2019s complicated.\\n\\nIt\u2019s easy enough to empathize with these arguments; 21st-century challenges like artificial intelligence, climate change, and the threat social media poses to democracy are astounding in their legal, social, and economic complexity. But while organizations may tell the public they\u2019ve got the \u201cbrightest minds\u201d working on a given issue to no avail, the roadblock is often not intellectual but political, says Marianne Jennings, a professor of legal and ethical studies at Arizona State University. Meaningful action is possible\u2014but when companies are unwilling to address root issues, it\u2019s often because doing so would threaten their revenue stream. Instead, they demand more research amid dire circumstances and promote distracting alternatives.\\n\\nThinkwashing is not thoughtfulness. It is not a helpful contribution to the discourse or an essential injection of skepticism. It\u2019s a way of obscuring the basic fact that \u201ccomplicated\u201d intellectual questions can often be answered, at least in part, by straightforward moral imperatives and a pragmatic approach to the future.\\n\\nOVER TIME, THINKWASHING has trickled down from corporate PR campaigns to the general public\u2014typically in the form of a profound techno-pessimism that is also an obstacle to action.\\n\\nTake direct-air carbon capture. Tech billionaires like Bill Gates, an investor in these plants, have suggested that they will one day be able to extract emissions out of the sky at scale, passively decarbonizing an electrified but otherwise largely unchanged world. Already, Microsoft has purchased one such facility, thereby helping to bring its business down to sub-zero emissions by 2030\u2014without necessarily disentangling itself from the fossil fuel economy (though it\u2019s promising to do some of that work too).\\n\\nThese plants are unlikely to keep pace with accelerating emissions, or to have significant impacts on atmospheric carbon in time to avert catastrophe, as article after article has laid out. While Microsoft may have found its silver bullet, negating the emissions of the current global economy would require a huge leap in extraction technology, the establishment of a vast new industry, the construction of plants around the world, and incredible amounts of energy to operate. Even then, if our consumption of fossil fuels continues to grow, we would still fail to neutralize the threat of carbon.\\nThese make for some serious shortcomings to this imagined techno-utopia. But that doesn\u2019t make these direct-air carbon capture efforts entirely useless. While these machines cannot decarbonize on our behalf, they could be helpful in a plan to draw down past emissions. Yet because some are overestimating the potential of carbon removal, cynics can seem to prematurely discard the premise altogether. Such is the cycle of techo-pessimist thinkwashing: the oversimplified idea, the hype, a wave of debunks. The galaxy brain is quickly exhausted, and people turn to a new topic, at least until some outlandish new claim pulls them back again.\\n\\nA similar false dichotomy\u2014between savior and despair\u2014has played out with numerous other technologies, including the clean-tech boom and bust of the early 2010s, hydrogen engines, and even the Covid-19 vaccine. In each case, the problem begins when the terms of the conversation are set by the techno-optimists. \u201cThe techno-optimist doesn\u2019t have a vision for the future at all,\u201d says Colin Koopman, head of the Philosophy Department and director of new media and culture at the University of Oregon. \u201cThey take the present and project it into the future.\u201d That leaves the techno-pessimists to respond with equal certainty\u2014decrying what won\u2019t work, what\u2019s insufficiently radical, what\u2019s a \u201cdistraction.\u201d\\n\\nThese critiques can be vitally important. Yet technology is, in fact, changing the world every day, for worse but also for better. When it comes to climate change, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported this spring that \u201cwe have the tools and know-how required to limit warming\u201d\u2014a hopeful message, if only politicians demonstrated any intention to act. Such optimism is based, in part, on the real and rapid success of photovoltaic arrays for solar energy production, battery technology for energy storage, and related technological achievements of the past 20 years.\\n\\nWhile certainty is comforting, both optimism and pessimism gamble with the nuance necessary for progress. Allowing the uninformed, unqualified speculations of billionaires to set the stage for such urgent discussions keeps concerned citizens on a hyperreal hamster wheel, far removed from the real action.\\n\\n:::tip DELIBERATION IS IMPORTANT \\n\\nDELIBERATION IS IMPORTANT in both public and private sector leadership. But action remains the goal. \u201cFor all the words, for all the targets, for all the, you know, moral entanglements\u201d of the climate crisis, says Stuart Capstick, a senior research fellow in psychology at Cardiff University, there is still a bottom line. To avoid mass death and destruction, we must decarbonize. A similar line exists for threats to democracy, human rights, and other core values; complicate them all you want, we must do something and we know at least a little bit about how.\\n:::"},{"id":"/drones-turning","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/drones-turning","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/drones-turning.md","source":"@site/blog/drones-turning.md","title":"Drones Are Turning Into Personal Flying Machines","description":"We were promised jetpacks that never arrived.

But you know what\u2019s finally here? Big, honking drones you can ride on.*\\n\\nEVER SINCE HE was a kid in Sweden, Peter Ternstr\xf6m wanted to make a sci-fi-style flying machine. In 1983 he saw Return of the Jedi five times and dreamed of zooming through the forest of Endor on a levitating speeder. But as a smart young nerd he quickly realized a hovering vehicle wasn\u2019t possible.\\n\\n\u201cThere was no propulsion system that worked,\u201d he recalls with a sigh. Sure, people had been trying to make personal flying devices for decades\u2014most notably jetpacks. But jetpack physics was a nightmare. Strapping an explosive tank of fuel to your body and trying not to burn your legs off? Not really a scalable solution to personal mobility.\\n\\nSo Ternstr\xf6m shelved his youthful dream and went on to become a dotcom millionaire by building an online learning platform and the Swedish version of Mailchimp. Flying cars, not gonna happen.\\n\\nExcept that technology evolves in a funny way. While Ternstr\xf6m was doing those dotcom firms, a different flying technology was emerging, one that didn\u2019t have the problems of jetpacks: drones.\\n\\nWhen they first went mainstream in the \u201900s, drones were mere toys, wobbly and difficult to fly, with batteries that died in minutes. But as demand from hobbyists and enthusiasts grew, so did the quality of the parts. Motors got better, and batteries became longer-lasting. Tilt sensors became cheap and high quality, and open-source coders wrote software that made drones self-stabilizing and thus easy to fly with zero training.\\n\\nIn 2012, Ternstr\xf6m met up with an old friend who\u2019d been building drones to carry cameras for Hollywood movie production. Ternstr\xf6m joined him to work on some of the shoots, and as he watched the drones fly around, Ternstr\xf6m started thinking: Huh, why not just make a really big drone, strap a seat on it, and carry a human?\\n\\nSo he and his partner did. They formed Jetson, a company that is now selling its first model of an honest-to-goodness, hovering personal aircraft: the Jetson ONE, a $92,000 contraption made of lightweight aluminum and carbon fiber, eight drone propellers, and scores of batteries. In videos, Ternstr\xf6m zooms along the Italian countryside about six feet aboveground, looking eerily like that Endor speeder he\u2019d once dreamed of.\\n\\n\u201cFlying it is a profoundly ecstatic experience,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAll your bird DNA from from millions of years ago kicks in and goes, \u2018Whoa, wait a second, I\'ve done this before!\u2019\u201d His company has 320 pre-orders, he adds, which he aims to begin delivering by the end of 2023. The buyers are mostly \u201chigh-profile people from California. I\u2019m not going to say \u2019Mark Zuckerberg,\u2019 but, you know, around that circle.\u201d\\n\\nTernstr\xf6m is one of the first to have a drone-style flying machine for sale, but he\u2019s hardly alone. Dozens of firms worldwide are now making \u201celectrical vertical takeoff and landing\u201d (eVTOL) vehicles. Their goal is to introduce vehicles and gradually improve them such that, in 10 years, you could zip from downtown to the airport in one\u2014since unlike planes they need no runway, and are so heavily software-guided that pilots would need little skill. (A few of these firms aim to have their crafts remotely piloted, or to fly autonomously.) Some models shift the propellers sideways once in flight, so they cruise airplane-style.\\n\\nFor eons, sci-fi illustrations depicted people zipping around cities in little flying vehicles. Now those Golden Age fliers might finally be arriving\u2014and \u201cthey\u2019re just big drones,\u201d says Chris Anderson, a longtime drone pioneer and COO of eVTOL firm Kittyhawk (and WIRED\u2019s former editor in chief).\\n\\nKittyhawk drone flying in cloudy blue sky\\nCOURTESY OF KITTYHAWK\\nConsider this a lesson in innovation: Big breakthroughs don\u2019t always come from where you\u2019d expect.\\n\\nWe often think the biggest innovations spring from brilliant people gathered in a lab or corporation\u2014designers at Apple crafting the smartphone, the wonks at OpenAI coding GPT-3, the Tesla engineers building a truly elegant electric car. But just as often, maybe more often, innovation is the result of hobbyist weirdos tinkering on stuff that seems silly or toylike. It\u2019s precisely because those environments are low-stakes that hackers and enthusiasts can gradually improve the core technologies, until suddenly they\u2019re ready to do wildly more ambitious things.\\n\\nWATCH\\n\\n\\nBiologist Explains How Drones Catching Whale \\"Snot\\" Helps Research\\n\\nMost Popular\\nPlayStation 5 and DualSense controller\\nGEAR\\nFinding a PlayStation 5 Is About to Get Easier\\n\\nMICHAEL CALORE\\n\\nAndy Yen, CEO of Proton\\nSECURITY\\nProton Is Trying to Become Google\u2014Without Your Data\\n\\nGILAD EDELMAN\\n\\nPile of green pencils on blue grey background\\nCULTURE\\nThe Most Powerful Story The Onion Ever Wrote\\n\\nANGELA WATERCUTTER\\n\\nSolo Stove Pi Oven\\nGEAR\\nThe 37 Best Memorial Day Deals on Tech, Gaming, Home, and More\\n\\nLOURYN STRAMPE AND GEAR TEAM\\n\\nDrone-car experiments burbled up in this way. Jeff Elkins, an electrical engineer and founder of Dragon Air, built his own flying device back in 2011 by arranging drone propellers on a platform. You stand on it, hold onto a couple poles, and lean to steer it. \u201cAs unintuitive as it sounds, it\'s actually a great way to fly,\u201d he tells me. His test pilot has done flights lasting as long as 20 minutes.\\n\\nThe idea of humans piloting flying cars might seem nuts\u2014we\u2019re lousy enough drivers in two dimensions. Adding a third seems ill advised. But software innovations from years of making drones easy to pilot has automated away most of the hard stuff of flying, says Volocopter CEO Florian Reuter.\\n\\n\u201cOur first test pilot, on his first flight, his comment was, \u2018This was the most boring maiden flight ever,\u2019\u201d Reuter tells me. You don\u2019t have to worry about keeping stable or reacting to sudden gusts of wind; the software takes care of that. You just use the joystick-like controls to point where you want to go. \u201cYou don\'t need any piloting skills,\u201d he says.\\n\\nMaking a flier out of drone parts has other advantages, which is safety through redundancy: A single propeller can fail while the others keep going. And if something goes really wrong? Several firms put ballistic parachutes in their machines. The HEXA, a flying machine by Lift Aircraft, has one that executives say will pop out so fast it\u2019ll save passengers from a height as low as 40 feet. The Jetson ONE also has a ballistic parachute, though Ternstr\xf6m says you\u2019d have to be at least 100 feet in the air for it to really save you. He expects most Jetson ONE riders will stick close to the ground, where in an accident you\u2019d be saved not by the parachute but by the roll cage.\\n\\n\u201cYou\'re going to break an arm. It\'s going to be painful, but you\'re not going to die,\u201d Ternstr\xf6m says.\\n\\nSo: Sci-fi flying vehicles can be built. Will they really change how we travel around, though? That\u2019s a different question, because it\u2019s not about technology but regulation\u2014which necessarily moves a lot more slowly.\\n\\nRight now, the only drone cars you could legally fly are the ones so lightweight that they qualify as \u201cultralights.\u201d (The Jetson ONE, the HEXA, and Jeff Elkins\u2019 craft all count.) With an ultralight you don\u2019t even need a pilot\u2019s license, though they can\u2019t be flown over congested areas. So the first crop of drone cars is essentially for joyrides.\\n\\nFor now, anyway. Many firms such as Kitty Hawk, Volocopter, or China\u2019s EHang are already building bigger vehicles that hold many passengers\u2014some that fly fully autonomously\u2014with the intent of creating full-on air taxis that flit us around cities. The Federal Aviation Administration will spend a decade or more approving those, mind you, assuming they ever do. But in the meantime, one thing is clear: Drones have grown up\u2014into something quite unexpected."}]}')}}]);
