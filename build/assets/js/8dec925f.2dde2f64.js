Even then, if our consumption of fossil fuels continues to grow, we would still fail to neutralize the threat of carbon.\nThese make for some serious shortcomings to this imagined techno-utopia.

While these machines cannot decarbonize on our behalf, they could be helpful in a plan to draw down past emissions. Yet because some are overestimating the potential of carbon removal, cynics can seem to prematurely discard the premise altogether.
