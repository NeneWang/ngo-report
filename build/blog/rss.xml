Koonin<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-science-is-not-settled-1411143565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> wrote in The Wall Street Journal in 2014</a>. ‚ÄúBut as far as the computer models go, there isn't a useful consensus at the level of detail relevant to assessing human influences.‚Äù The idea was that the world needed more data before it could respond to the threat posed by global warming‚Äîassuming such research indicated a response was even necessary.</p><p>Today, outright denialism is dormant, but delay tactics have never been more in vogue. Many of them fall under the banner of what I‚Äôd call thinkwashing, a combination of willful ignorance of existing knowledge, policy perfectionism, and an all-or-nothing position on the role of technology in society. It‚Äôs not limited to climate change, either. People thinkwash whenever they magnify the complexity of the problem and undermine real possibilities. Whatever the issue, entrenched interests have perfected their response: It‚Äôs complicated.</p><p>It‚Äôs easy enough to empathize with these arguments; 21st-century challenges like artificial intelligence, climate change, and the threat social media poses to democracy are astounding in their legal, social, and economic complexity. But while organizations may tell the public they‚Äôve got the ‚Äúbrightest minds‚Äù working on a given issue to no avail, the roadblock is often not intellectual but political, says Marianne Jennings, a professor of legal and ethical studies at Arizona State University. Meaningful action is possible‚Äîbut when companies are unwilling to address root issues, it‚Äôs often because doing so would threaten their revenue stream. Instead, they demand more research amid dire circumstances and promote distracting alternatives.</p><p>Thinkwashing is not thoughtfulness. It is not a helpful contribution to the discourse or an essential injection of skepticism. It‚Äôs a way of obscuring the basic fact that ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù intellectual questions can often be answered, at least in part, by straightforward moral imperatives and a pragmatic approach to the future.</p><p>OVER TIME, THINKWASHING has trickled down from corporate PR campaigns to the general public‚Äîtypically in the form of a profound techno-pessimism that is also an obstacle to action.</p><p>Take direct-air carbon capture. Tech billionaires like Bill Gates, an investor in these plants, have suggested that they will one day be able to extract emissions out of the sky at scale, passively decarbonizing an electrified but otherwise largely unchanged world. Already, Microsoft has purchased one such facility, thereby helping to bring its business down to sub-zero emissions by 2030‚Äîwithout necessarily disentangling itself from the fossil fuel economy (though it‚Äôs promising to do some of that work too).</p><p>These plants are unlikely to keep pace with accelerating emissions, or to have significant impacts on atmospheric carbon in time to avert catastrophe, as article after article has laid out. While Microsoft may have found its silver bullet, negating the emissions of the current global economy would require a huge leap in extraction technology, the establishment of a vast new industry, the construction of plants around the world, and incredible amounts of energy to operate. Even then, if our consumption of fossil fuels continues to grow, we would still fail to neutralize the threat of carbon.
These make for some serious shortcomings to this imagined techno-utopia. But that doesn‚Äôt make these direct-air carbon capture efforts entirely useless. While these machines cannot decarbonize on our behalf, they could be helpful in a plan to draw down past emissions. Yet because some are overestimating the potential of carbon removal, cynics can seem to prematurely discard the premise altogether. Such is the cycle of techo-pessimist thinkwashing: the oversimplified idea, the hype, a wave of debunks. The galaxy brain is quickly exhausted, and people turn to a new topic, at least until some outlandish new claim pulls them back again.</p><p>A similar false dichotomy‚Äîbetween savior and despair‚Äîhas played out with numerous other technologies, including the clean-tech boom and bust of the early 2010s, hydrogen engines, and even the Covid-19 vaccine. In each case, the problem begins when the terms of the conversation are set by the techno-optimists. ‚ÄúThe techno-optimist doesn‚Äôt have a vision for the future at all,‚Äù says Colin Koopman, head of the Philosophy Department and director of new media and culture at the University of Oregon. ‚ÄúThey take the present and project it into the future.‚Äù That leaves the techno-pessimists to respond with equal certainty‚Äîdecrying what won‚Äôt work, what‚Äôs insufficiently radical, what‚Äôs a ‚Äúdistraction.‚Äù</p><p>These critiques can be vitally important. Yet technology is, in fact, changing the world every day, for worse but also for better. When it comes to climate change, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported this spring that ‚Äúwe have the tools and know-how required to limit warming‚Äù‚Äîa hopeful message, if only politicians demonstrated any intention to act. Such optimism is based, in part, on the real and rapid success of photovoltaic arrays for solar energy production, battery technology for energy storage, and related technological achievements of the past 20 years.</p><p>While certainty is comforting, both optimism and pessimism gamble with the nuance necessary for progress. Allowing the uninformed, unqualified speculations of billionaires to set the stage for such urgent discussions keeps concerned citizens on a hyperreal hamster wheel, far removed from the real action.</p><div class="admonition admonition-tip alert alert--success"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="12" height="16" viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>DELIBERATION IS IMPORTANT </h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p>DELIBERATION IS IMPORTANT in both public and private sector leadership.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>We were promised jetpacks that never arrived. But you know what‚Äôs finally here? Big, honking drones you can ride on.</em></p><p>EVER SINCE HE was a kid in Sweden, Peter Ternstr√∂m wanted to make a sci-fi-style flying machine. In 1983 he saw Return of the Jedi five times and dreamed of zooming through the forest of Endor on a levitating speeder. But as a smart young nerd he quickly realized a hovering vehicle wasn‚Äôt possible.</p><p>‚ÄúThere was no propulsion system that worked,‚Äù he recalls with a sigh. Sure, people had been trying to make personal flying devices for decades‚Äîmost notably jetpacks. But jetpack physics was a nightmare. Strapping an explosive tank of fuel to your body and trying not to burn your legs off? Not really a scalable solution to personal mobility.</p><p>So Ternstr√∂m shelved his youthful dream and went on to become a dotcom millionaire by building an online learning platform and the Swedish version of Mailchimp. Flying cars, not gonna happen.</p><p>Except that technology evolves in a funny way. While Ternstr√∂m was doing those dotcom firms, a different flying technology was emerging, one that didn‚Äôt have the problems of jetpacks: drones.</p><p>When they first went mainstream in the ‚Äô00s, drones were mere toys, wobbly and difficult to fly, with batteries that died in minutes. But as demand from hobbyists and enthusiasts grew, so did the quality of the parts. Motors got better, and batteries became longer-lasting. Tilt sensors became cheap and high quality, and open-source coders wrote software that made drones self-stabilizing and thus easy to fly with zero training.</p><p>In 2012, Ternstr√∂m met up with an old friend who‚Äôd been building drones to carry cameras for Hollywood movie production. Ternstr√∂m joined him to work on some of the shoots, and as he watched the drones fly around, Ternstr√∂m started thinking: Huh, why not just make a really big drone, strap a seat on it, and carry a human?</p><p>So he and his partner did. They formed Jetson, a company that is now selling its first model of an honest-to-goodness, hovering personal aircraft: the Jetson ONE, a $92,000 contraption made of lightweight aluminum and carbon fiber, eight drone propellers, and scores of batteries. In videos, Ternstr√∂m zooms along the Italian countryside about six feet aboveground, looking eerily like that Endor speeder he‚Äôd once dreamed of.</p><p>‚ÄúFlying it is a profoundly ecstatic experience,‚Äù he tells me. ‚ÄúAll your bird DNA from from millions of years ago kicks in and goes, ‚ÄòWhoa, wait a second, I've done this before!‚Äô‚Äù His company has 320 pre-orders, he adds, which he aims to begin delivering by the end of 2023. The buyers are mostly ‚Äúhigh-profile people from California. I‚Äôm not going to say ‚ÄôMark Zuckerberg,‚Äô but, you know, around that circle.‚Äù</p><p>Ternstr√∂m is one of the first to have a drone-style flying machine for sale, but he‚Äôs hardly alone. Dozens of firms worldwide are now making ‚Äúelectrical vertical takeoff and landing‚Äù (eVTOL) vehicles. Their goal is to introduce vehicles and gradually improve them such that, in 10 years, you could zip from downtown to the airport in one‚Äîsince unlike planes they need no runway, and are so heavily software-guided that pilots would need little skill. (A few of these firms aim to have their crafts remotely piloted, or to fly autonomously.) Some models shift the propellers sideways once in flight, so they cruise airplane-style.</p><p>For eons, sci-fi illustrations depicted people zipping around cities in little flying vehicles. Now those Golden Age fliers might finally be arriving‚Äîand ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just big drones,‚Äù says Chris Anderson, a longtime drone pioneer and COO of eVTOL firm Kittyhawk (and WIRED‚Äôs former editor in chief).</p><p>Kittyhawk drone flying in cloudy blue sky

Consider this a lesson in innovation: Big breakthroughs don‚Äôt always come from where you‚Äôd expect.</p><p>We often think the biggest innovations spring from brilliant people gathered in a lab or corporation‚Äîdesigners at Apple crafting the smartphone, the wonks at OpenAI coding GPT-3, the Tesla engineers building a truly elegant electric car. But just as often, maybe more often, innovation is the result of hobbyist weirdos tinkering on stuff that seems silly or toylike. It‚Äôs precisely because those environments are low-stakes that hackers and enthusiasts can gradually improve the core technologies, until suddenly they‚Äôre ready to do wildly more ambitious things.</p><p>WATCH</p><p>Biologist Explains How Drones Catching Whale "Snot" Helps Research</p><p>Most Popular

Jeff Elkins, an electrical engineer and founder of Dragon Air, built his own flying device back in 2011 by arranging drone propellers on a platform. You stand on it, hold onto a couple poles, and lean to steer it. ‚ÄúAs unintuitive as it sounds, it's actually a great way to fly,‚Äù he tells me. His test pilot has done flights lasting as long as 20 minutes.</p><p>The idea of humans piloting flying cars might seem nuts‚Äîwe‚Äôre lousy enough drivers in two dimensions. Adding a third seems ill advised. But software innovations from years of making drones easy to pilot has automated away most of the hard stuff of flying, says Volocopter CEO Florian Reuter.</p><p>‚ÄúOur first test pilot, on his first flight, his comment was, ‚ÄòThis was the most boring maiden flight ever,‚Äô‚Äù Reuter tells me. You don‚Äôt have to worry about keeping stable or reacting to sudden gusts of wind; the software takes care of that. You just use the joystick-like controls to point where you want to go. ‚ÄúYou don't need any piloting skills,‚Äù he says.</p><p>Making a flier out of drone parts has other advantages, which is safety through redundancy: A single propeller can fail while the others keep going. And if something goes really wrong? Several firms put ballistic parachutes in their machines. The HEXA, a flying machine by Lift Aircraft, has one that executives say will pop out so fast it‚Äôll save passengers from a height as low as 40 feet. The Jetson ONE also has a ballistic parachute, though Ternstr√∂m says you‚Äôd have to be at least 100 feet in the air for it to really save you. He expects most Jetson ONE riders will stick close to the ground, where in an accident you‚Äôd be saved not by the parachute but by the roll cage.</p><p>‚ÄúYou're going to break an arm. It's going to be painful, but you're not going to die,‚Äù Ternstr√∂m says.</p><p>So: Sci-fi flying vehicles can be built. Will they really change how we travel around, though? That‚Äôs a different question, because it‚Äôs not about technology but regulation‚Äîwhich necessarily moves a lot more slowly.</p><p>Right now, the only drone cars you could legally fly are the ones so lightweight that they qualify as ‚Äúultralights.‚Äù (The Jetson ONE, the HEXA, and Jeff Elkins‚Äô craft all count.) With an ultralight you don‚Äôt even need a pilot‚Äôs license, though they can‚Äôt be flown over congested areas. So the first crop of drone cars is essentially for joyrides.</p><p>For now, anyway. Many firms such as Kitty Hawk, Volocopter, or China‚Äôs EHang are already building bigger vehicles that hold many passengers‚Äîsome that fly fully autonomously‚Äîwith the intent of creating full-on air taxis that flit us around cities. The Federal Aviation Administration will spend a decade or more approving those, mind you, assuming they ever do. But in the meantime, one thing is clear: Drones have grown up‚Äîinto something quite unexpected.</p>]]></content:encoded>
