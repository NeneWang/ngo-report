# Free Consultants

:::tip Proposition

- Start a free-consultancy agency (For NGO's) using college students.
- They don't have to hire interns and go to an interview process, or host spaces.
- They just contact NGO Global and we have a listing of College Students happily willing to do marketing/funding consultancy for experience.

:::

- I think they will be happy doing for now a free agency system
