## Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme

##### (ESMAP)

**What activities does the program fund?** ESMAP is a global
technical assistance program that promotes the role of energy in
poverty reduction and economic growth in an environmentally
responsible manner. Its work applies to low-income, emerging, and
transition economies and contributes to the achievement of
internationally agreed development goals.
Through studies, pilot projects and training, ESMAP strives to
expand the global knowledge base about its priority areas: market-
oriented sector reform and restructuring, energy access to the un- or
under-served especially in rural areas, and environmentally
sustainable energy practices. Activities should also contribute to the
institutional and human capacity in the recipient country; address
poverty, social and gender issues; and be innovative in developing,
testing, and mainstreaming ideas and approaches.

**Who is eligible?** All stakeholders in the energy sector:
governments, private sector, research institutions and NGOs.

**How to apply?** ESMAP activities are managed by World Bank
energy specialists. Proposals for activities are submitted to the
Manager of ESMAP and reviewed by independent experts. Non-
World Bank Group proponents need to secure the commitment of a
World Bank energy specialist before their proposals can be
considered by ESMAP. ESMAP staff are available to put proponents
in touch with World Bank energy staff and can be contacted at
address below. Further information is available on its website.

## Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility

##### (PPIAF)

**What activities does the Program fund?** PPIAF is a multi-
donor technical assistance facility aimed at helping developing
country governments improve the quality of their infrastructure
through private sector involvement. PPIAF pursues its objectives
through (i) channeling technical assistance to governments in
developing countries on strategies and measures to tap the full
potential of private sector involvement in infrastructure, and (ii)
identifying, disseminating and promoting emerging best practices
on matters related to private sector involvement in infrastructure in
developing countries.

PPIAF funds country specific or multi-country advisory and related
activities in the following areas: infrastructure development
strategies, capacity and consensus building, policy, regulatory, and
institutional reforms, and pioneering transactions. Eligible
infrastructure services include water and sewerage, solid waste,
electricity generation, transmission and distribution, natural gas
transmission and distribution, telecommunications, airports, ports,
railways, and roads.

**Who is eligible?** PPIAF can support activities intended to benefit
any developing and transition country included in the following
categories of the OECD Development Assistance Committeeâ€™s List of
Aid Recipients: Developing Countries and Territories (all five
columns of the Part I table); and Countries and Territories in
Transition (column one of the Part II table). Proposals for PPIAF
support can originate from any source. Note, however, that since
PPIAF donors have agreed to utilize World Bank procurement
guidelines to implement PPIAF activities, the World Bank through
its designated task managers execute activities on behalf of PPIAF.
Proposals for country-specific activities require approval in writing
from the relevant government.
**How to apply?** Guidelines and information are available on the
PPIAF website or from PPIAF Program Management.
